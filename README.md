# Image Recognition

This project uses Image Recognition to classify randomly selected images. ConvNet models, VGG19 and Xception, were trained using a new dataset. The trained model with the best result was used to  classify images.  

## Project Team

* Debbie Chan
* SeouHung Jung
* Rupali Shah

## Dataset

Images were downloaded from Google Images and classified into eight categories (animals, beaches, birds, electronics, fashion, landmarks, nature,and people).

## Training Platform

The models were trained on FloydHub.  

## Analysis

The trained model was analyzed using a Confusion Matrix and a Classification Report.
